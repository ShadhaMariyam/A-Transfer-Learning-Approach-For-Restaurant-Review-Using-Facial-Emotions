# A-Transfer-Learning-Approach-For-Restaurant-Review-Using-Facial-Emotions

The rapid growth of online restaurant review platforms has significantly influenced consumer decision-making in
the food and hospitality industry. This paper presents a novel
approach to restaurant review systems using deep learning to
analyze facial emotions. By using facial emotion recognition, our
system offers a comprehensive method to assess customer satisfaction and review quality.The proposed system utilizes a deep
learning framework to detect and interpret facial expressions
from video or image data captured during dining experiences.
This data is processed to identify emotional states. Our deep
learning model is trained on a diverse dataset of facial expressions
and associated sentiment labels to ensure high accuracy and
robustness.The model is fine-tuned to classify emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality, aiming to provide efficient and real-time emotion detection capabilities which inturn can be used for restaurent review.The system’s outputs provide restaurant managers
with real-time insights into customer emotions, enhancing their
ability to respond promptly to service issues and improve overall
dining experiences. By integrating emotional feedback, the proposed approach offers a richer and more nuanced understanding
of customer satisfaction. In essence, this innovative method
emerges as a valuable asset for both restaurant stakeholders
and customers alike. For restaurant owners and managers, it
becomes a pivotal tool for data-driven decision-making, enabling
them to enhance service quality and customer satisfaction.
For customers, it offers a platform to express emotions and
preferences effectively, fostering a personalized and enriching
dining experience.
## Project Structure

- **Data**: The FER2013 dataset, divided into `train`, `val`, and `test` directories.
- **Model**: The project leverages MobileNetV2, a lightweight model, fine-tuned for the specific task of emotion classification.

## Dataset

The **FER2013** dataset consists of grey scale images of faces, each classified into one of seven emotions.Images are resized and converted to RGB, allowing compatibility with MobileNetV2.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on MobileNetV2 with a custom classification head for emotion recognition. Key components include:

-**1. Base Model:**

Pretrained MobileNetV2 initialized with ImageNet weights.
The base model’s layers are initially frozen to leverage pre-trained feature extraction, minimizing the need for extensive training data.


-**2. Fine-Tuning:**

The last 30 layers of MobileNetV2 are unfrozen and fine-tuned, allowing the model to adapt better to emotion recognition tasks in the FER2013 dataset.


-**3. Custom Classification Head:**

Global Average Pooling Layer: Reduces each feature map to a single value, helping to prevent overfitting.
Fully Connected Layers: Includes Dense layers with BatchNormalization and Dropout to improve generalization.
Output Layer: Dense layer with softmax activation for seven emotion classes.
This architecture balances efficiency and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications with limited computational resources.

## Training Strategy
-**Data Augmentation:** Applied transformations such as rotations, zooming, shifts, and horizontal flips to improve generalization.


-**Optimizer:** Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001, chosen for its adaptive learning rate and convergence capabilities.


-**Callbacks:** Implemented ReduceLROnPlateau to adjust the learning rate dynamically when the model's performance plateaus.


## Model Evaluation
The model achieves a test accuracy of approximately 64% with a test loss of around 1.0, providing effective emotion recognition within the constraints of limited computational resources.
## Future Improvement
Potential enhancements to increase model accuracy and robustness include:

-**Attention Mechanisms:**

Adding attention layers (e.g., self-attention or spatial attention) could help the model focus on key regions of the face, such as the eyes and mouth, which are highly expressive areas for emotion recognition.
