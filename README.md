# A-Transfer-Learning-Approach-For-Restaurant-Review-Using-Facial-Emotions

The rapid growth of online restaurant review platforms has significantly influenced consumer decision-making in
the food and hospitality industry. This paper presents a novel
approach to restaurant review systems using deep learning to
analyze facial emotions. By using facial emotion recognition, our
system offers a comprehensive method to assess customer satisfaction and review quality.The proposed system utilizes a deep
learning framework to detect and interpret facial expressions
from video or image data captured during dining experiences.
This data is processed to identify emotional states. Our deep
learning model is trained on a diverse dataset of facial expressions
and associated sentiment labels to ensure high accuracy and
robustness.The systemâ€™s outputs provide restaurant managers
with real-time insights into customer emotions, enhancing their
ability to respond promptly to service issues and improve overall
dining experiences. By integrating emotional feedback, the proposed approach offers a richer and more nuanced understanding
of customer satisfaction. In essence, this innovative method
emerges as a valuable asset for both restaurant stakeholders
and customers alike. For restaurant owners and managers, it
becomes a pivotal tool for data-driven decision-making, enabling
them to enhance service quality and customer satisfaction.
For customers, it offers a platform to express emotions and
preferences effectively, fostering a personalized and enriching
dining experience
